# ArchCiggies
A lightweight &amp; portable Arch ISO environment.

***

## Prerequisites
- A system running Arch or an Arch-based distribution (haven't tested these!)
- A USB drive and a way to flash it (Etcher works just fine, Ventoy should work here too)

***

## Why is it called ArchCiggies?
Also purely for comedic value. It isn't an acronym for anything, I just thought it was memorable. Also another suggested name.

## What can ArchCiggies do?
Provide a base environment where you can install Arch from, or use as a recovery environment, or to have a non-persistent install. The world is yours, go take it.

## What can it not do?
It can't do anything a regular Arch Linux ISO can't.

## Is it just you that works on ArchCiggies, 4rotr?
Yes, for now.
